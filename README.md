Nibble Shift
---

So this is a very non-serious project. 

Last night I had a stroke of genius. How annoying would it be to be sent a file, and it be totally unreadable. 
Sent a .jpg, a .exe, even a .txt, and have it be just meaningless.

Also how cool would it be to have a custom file extension!

And so this was born. 

Run with the desired input, such as input.txt.

--unrev flag runs the exact same code, but automatically sets the output to a different file name to avoid corruption.

--output lets you select the output file. 

Have fun.
